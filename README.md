# NLP-MODELS
A paragraph in this project represents a structured piece of business-related text that needs to be classified into one of five categories: Biographies, Philosophy, Programming, Artificial Intelligence, or Movies about Artificial Intelligence. Each paragraph varies in complexity and vocabulary, and may include named entities or domain-specific terms. These paragraphs are preprocessed through tokenization and vectorization, enabling models to understand semantic and syntactic patterns. The goal is to automatically classify each paragraph based on its content and context, enhancing the efficiency of information sorting and retrieval.
